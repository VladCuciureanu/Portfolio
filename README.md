### Who am I?

&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a <i>full-stack developer</i> based in <i>Cluj-Napoca, Romania</i>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;For as long as I can remember I've been trying to extend my understanding of computers by tinkering and programming. And so I did - with every project I've taken on (and abandoned). Now, I'm hoping to make this world a little better through developing (and contributing to) open-source solutions.

### What I'm focusing on

<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp; Currently I'm working on <u><b>Hymn</b></u>: an open-source, non-profit, free access christian music tabs repository with user friendliness and ease of use in mind. If, by chance, you're interested in helping/checking Hymn out, you can find it [here](https://github.com/VladCuciureanu/Hymn). -->

- Exploring <i>audio streaming</i> with <u>[Lyra](https://github.com/VladCuciureanu/Lyra)</u><br/>
- Experimenting on <i>collaboration</i> tools at <u>[Hymn](https://github.com/VladCuciureanu/Hymn)</u><br/>
