### Who am I?

&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a full-stack developer based in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. For as long as I can remember I've been trying to extend my understanding of computers by tinkering and programming. And so I did, with every project I've taken on (and abandoned ðŸ˜¢). Now, I'm hoping to make this world a little better through developing (and contributing to) open-source solutions.

### What I'm focusing on

<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp; Currently I'm working on <u><b>Hymn</b></u>: an open-source, non-profit, free access christian music tabs repository with user friendliness and ease of use in mind. If, by chance, you're interested in helping/checking Hymn out, you can find it [here](https://github.com/VladCuciureanu/Hymn). -->
&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently I'm working on <u><b>Lyra</b></u>: an open-source audio streaming server with ease of use and audio fidelity in mind.
</br>By the way... If youÂ´re interested in helping/checking Lyra out, you can find it [here](https://github.com/VladCuciureanu/Lyra).
