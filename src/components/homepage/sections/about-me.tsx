          Since before I can remember, I loved <i>anything</i> tech. I would
          spend <strong>hours</strong> exploring the depths of my father&apos;s
          desktop, trying to figure out how the games I used to play and Windows
          (the operating system) functioned. Lost count of how many times I
          bricked the system.

          Fast-forward a few years, I got my first internship at 16 years old,
          as a <i>C++ game engine developer</i> at a small corporation.
          Afterwards, I transitioned to <i>full-stack web development</i>,
          working on various stacks until landing on <i>React</i> and{" "}
          <i>Express</i>, alongside <i>Typescript</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main focus these days is building <i>web products</i>. In my free
          time I&apos;m also working on various personal projects.{" "}

          When I&apos;m not at the computer, I&apos;m usually hanging out with
          my wife, enjoying a cold brew tonic, or studying audio synthesis.
