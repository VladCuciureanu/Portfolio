              Since before I can remember, I loved anything tech. I would spend
              hours exploring the depths of my father&apos;s desktop, trying to
              figure out how the games I used to play and Windows (the operating
              system) functioned. Lost count of how many times I bricked the
              system.

              Fast-forward a few years, at 16 years old, I got my first
              internship at{" "}

                a small corporation
              </Link>{" "}
              as a C++ game engine developer . Several years later, I
              transitioned to full-stack web development, working on various
              stacks until landing on React and Express, alongside Typescript.

              When I&apos;m not at the computer, I&apos;m usually hanging out
              with my wife, enjoying a cold brew tonic, or studying audio
              synthesis.
