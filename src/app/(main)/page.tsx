              Since before I can remember, I loved <i>anything</i> tech. I would
              spend <strong>hours</strong> exploring the depths of my
              father&apos;s desktop, trying to figure out how the games I used
              to play and Windows (the operating system) functioned. Lost count
              of how many times I bricked the system.

              Fast-forward a few years, I got my first internship at 16 years
              old, as a <i>C++ game engine developer</i> at a small corporation.
              Several years later, I transitioned to{" "}
              <i>full-stack web development</i>, working on various stacks until
              landing on <i>React</i> and <i>Express</i>, alongside{" "}
              <i>Typescript</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              My main focus these days is building <i>web products</i> as a{" "}
              <i>contractor</i>. In my free time I&apos;m also working on
              various personal projects.{" "}

              When I&apos;m not at the computer, I&apos;m usually hanging out
              with my wife, enjoying a cold brew tonic, or studying audio
              synthesis.
